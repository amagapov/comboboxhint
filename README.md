The module overrides the TcxComboBox and TcxImageComboBox components, 
adding hint display functionality to the dropdown list items.

There are settings (optional):
- HintDisplayPause - pause before the hint appears (1 second by default); 
- HintDisplayDuration - duration of hint displaying (by default 4 seconds); 
- ScrollHEnabled - you can remove horizontal scroll, which is always in the way when closing the last/bottom element (by default horizontal scroll is hidden);
- HintOnlyOnHiddenText - you can show hint over all elements, or over those which don't fit in length (by default hint only over those which don't fit).

To use this functionality you need to plug the module in uses (last in the list of plugins).
